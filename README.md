# Thumbprint

Thumbprint is the design system at Thumbtack. Though its primary purpose to support Thumbtack projects, we have open-sourced it for those interested in how we build and manage our documentation and code.

## Documentation

Thumbprint is documented at [thumbprint.design](https://thumbprint.design/).

## Playground

The Thumbprint repo includes a Target named `Playground` and it's a sandbox app where those interested can test out the different Thumbprint components. It can be a great place to get a sense for the components before using them.
